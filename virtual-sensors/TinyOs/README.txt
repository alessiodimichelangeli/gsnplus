README for TinyOs Virtual Sensors

**** AUTHOR: **** 

Alessio Di Michelangeli


**** DESCRIPTION: ****

Please, before writing a new TinyOs Virtual Sensor, take a look at the TinyOsTEMPLATE.

From the template you learned that with a TinyOs like Virtual Sensor you can do the follows:
- read messages (generated by mig) from the TinyOs sensors via Serial Forwarder
- change the sample interval from a message to the new one
- send a command to a certain mote via mote_id

Please note, there is a virtual sensor for each tinyos mote because it is more simple manage messages and web upload in this way, furthermore, is more clear the outputs data view for the user.
Therefore, you have to write a new TinyOs Virtual Sensor for each mote of your network.


ATTENTION!!! You can't set the interval value too small. You have to consider that from a query to the new one must spend at least a second so, you can't set the interval in the way that two messages arrive in less than 1 second.


**** ABOUT TOSSIM VS: ****

If you want to test the TinyOs integration with GSN+, please cut the TOSSIM.xml file and paste it into the folder virtual-sensors .
You have to follow the WIKI instruction but the most important thing is that, after the previous operation, before running
GSN+ (via ant gsn) you have to launch the python script (TossimGsnplus.py) located into the folder of the TossimGsnplus app.
This is because GSN+ has to read messages coming from the Serial Forwarder written by the TossimGsnplus app otherwise 
GSN+ will stop immediately.
