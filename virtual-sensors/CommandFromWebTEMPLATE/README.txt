README for CommandFromWeb Virtual Sensors

**** AUTHOR: **** 

Alessio Di Michelangeli


**** DESCRIPTION: ****

Please, before writing a new CommandFromWeb Virtual Sensor, take a look at the CommandFromWebTEMPLATE.

From the template you learned that with a CommandFromWeb like Virtual Sensor you can 
send a message/command from the GSN Server to the Sensors.
Basically you can add this functionality to all the sensors where the web upload makes sense.
