README for TinyOs Virtual Sensors

**** AUTHOR: ****

**** DESCRIPTION: ****

Please, before writing a new TinyOs Virtual Sensor, take a look at the TinyOsTEMPLATE.

From the template you learned that with a TinyOs like Virtual Sensor you can do the follows:
- read messages (generated by mig) from the TinyOs sensors via Serial Forwarder
- change the sample interval from a message to the new one
- send a command to a certain mote via mote_id

ATTENTION!!! You can't set the interval value too small. You have to consider that from a query to the new one must spend at least a second so, you can't set the interval in the way that two messages arrive in less than 1 second.
